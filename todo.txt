when importing a file but with an uppercase letter, e.g.
    file: test.che
    code: import Test
the compiler successfully imports it but as a new file, causing other errors
we should report an error at the import location


- labeled block + break from block
    + add label to block
    + break from block
    + defer working
    - test nesting in blocks and loops
- immutable/mutable variables
- public/private struct members
- number constants as polymorphic parameters
- loop as expression with value (provided by break)
- polymorphic constraints (e.g. $T/Printable)
- properly implement lambdas

- improve error messages when type of const argument doesn't match type of const parameter (location shown is from param)
- return in match as expression
