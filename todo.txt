- move map of initialized symbols from scope to block
- improve error messages when type of const argument doesn't match type of const parameter (location shown is from param)


Thoughts:
- even in 32 bit mode pointers in llvm are 8 byte
- llvm structs are padded this StructType adds padding so that all members are 8 byte aligned
