# Examples

This folder contains examples.

- `bmp` - Library for creating `.bmp` files
- `std` - The current 'standard library'
- `compiler` - Started working on a self hosted compiler, but not very far yet
- `glfw` - Wrapper library for `GLFW`. Needs `glfw3dll.lib` in the same folder. And `glfw3.dll` next to the .exe of course. Prebuilt binaries are already included if you don't want to install/build them yourself
- `opengl` - Wrapper for OpenGL and GLEW. Incomplete. Requires `glew32s.lib` for GLEW. Prebuilt binaries are already included if you don't want to install/build them yourself
- `examples` - A few examples. Probably not all working right now. `signed_distance_field_renderer.che` should work.
